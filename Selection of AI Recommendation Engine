# ADR N: Selection of AI Recommendation Engine

# Forces Influencing the Decision
Technological: Recommendation accuracy, scalability, and adaptability to user preferences.
Cost-related: Measurable power for training models, ongoing maintenance expenses.
Project Local: Combination with NovelNest, user engagement impact.

# Decision
We will adopt a hybrid AI recommendation engine that combines collaborative filtering and content-based approaches to personalize book suggestions effectively.

# Rationale
A hybrid model ensures both personalization and flexibility in recommendations. Other methods were considered but ultimately rejected:
Pure collaborative filtering was discarded due to cold-start issues for new users.
Pure content-based filtering was discarded due to restricted recommendation diversity.

# Status
Proposed

# Consequences
Positive: Highly personalized recommendations, improved engagement, and adaptability.
Negative: Increased measurable load and potential complexity in tuning models.

# Alignment with AWS Well-Architected Pillars
Operational Excellence: AI adapts to user preferences, ensuring a seamless experience.
Performance Efficiency: Optimized algorithms reduce delay and improve recommendation speed.
Cost Optimization: Balances model complexity with measurable efficiency to minimize expenses.
