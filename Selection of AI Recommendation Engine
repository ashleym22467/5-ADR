# ADR N: Selection of AI Recommendation Engine

## Forces Influencing the Decision:
Technological: Recommendation accuracy, scalability, and adaptability to user preferences.
Cost-related: Computational power for training models, ongoing maintenance expenses.
Project Local: Integration with NovelNest, user engagement impact.

## Decision 
We will adopt a hybrid AI recommendation engine utilizing both collaborative filtering and content-based approaches to personalize book suggestions effectively.

## Rationale 
A hybrid model balances personalized recommendations with flexibility. Pure collaborative filtering was rejected due to cold-start issues for new users, while content-based filtering alone was deemed too restrictive. Alternative methods were rejected due to limitations:

Pure collaborative filtering was discarded due to cold-start issues for new users.
Pure content-based filtering was discarded due to restricted recommendation diversity.

## Status
Proposed 

## Consequences
Positive: Highly personalized recommendations, improved engagement, and adaptability.
Negative: Increased computational load, potential complexity in tuning models.

Alignment with AWS Well-Architected Pillars: Operational Excellence: AI evolves with user preferences, ensuring an intuitive experience. Performance Efficiency: Optimized algorithms reduce latency and improve recommendation speed. Cost Optimization: Balances model complexity with computational efficiency to minimize expenses.
