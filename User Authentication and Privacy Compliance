# ADR N: User Authentication and Privacy Compliance

# Forces Influencing the Decision
Technological: Security best practices, frictionless authentication experience.
Cost-related: Implementation costs, third-party authentication service fees.
Project Local: Compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy laws.

# Decision
We will implement OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for authentication, ensuring secure user access and regulatory compliance.

# Rationale
OAuth 2.0 enhances security by eliminating direct password storage while providing a smooth, user-friendly login experience. Alternative methods were considered but ultimately rejected:
Traditional username/password authentication was discarded due to security vulnerabilities and poor user experience.
SAML was discarded due to complex integration requirements.

# Status
Proposed

# Consequences
Positive: Enhanced security, reduced risk of credential leaks, improved privacy compliance.
Negative: Initial complexity in combining, reliance on third-party authentication providers.

# Alignment with AWS Well-Architected Pillars
Security: Strong encryption and multi-factor authentication protect user data.
Reliability: Reduced risk of credential leaks strengthens platform trust.
Operational Excellence: A streamlined sign-in process improves user experience.
