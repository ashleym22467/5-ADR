# ADR N: User Authentication and Privacy Compliance

## Forces Influencing the Decision:
Technological: Security best practices, frictionless authentication experience.
Cost-related: Implementation costs, third-party authentication service fees.
Project Local: Compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy laws.

## Decision 
We will implement OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for authentication, ensuring secure user access and regulatory compliance.

## Rationale 
OAuth 2.0 improves security by eliminating direct password storage while offering seamless user login. Traditional username/password authentication was rejected due to security concerns and poor user experience. Alternatives were rejected:

Traditional username/password authentication was discarded due to security vulnerabilities.
SAML was discarded due to integration complexity

## Status
Proposed 

## Consequences
Positive: Enhanced security, reduced risk of credential leaks, privacy compliance.
Negative: Initial complexity in integration, reliance on third-party authentication providers.

Alignment with AWS Well-Architected Pillars: Security: Strong encryption and multi-factor authentication ensure data protection. Reliability: Reduced risk of credential leaks enhances platform trust. Operational Excellence: Streamlined sign-in process improves user experience.
