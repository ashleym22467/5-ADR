# ADR N: Continuous Deployment and Version Control Strategy

# Forces Influencing the Decision
Technological: Automation efficiency, rollback capabilities, integration with testing workflows.
Cost-related: Maintenance costs, infrastructure dependencies.
Project Local: Alignment with Git-based development workflows, deployment frequency.

# Decision
We will implement GitHub Actions as our CI/CD pipeline to automate deployments and testing while ensuring version control.

# Rationale
GitHub Actions offers seamless code merging, automated testing, and reliable rollback mechanisms. Other CI/CD solutions were evaluated but ultimately rejected:
Jenkins was discarded due to high setup and maintenance overhead.
GitLab CI was discarded due to repository hosting limitations and integration challenges.

# Status
Proposed

# Consequences
Positive: Faster development cycles, reduced manual action, improved collaboration.
Negative: Learning curve for workflow customization, dependency on GitHub infrastructure.

# Alignment with AWS Well-Architected Pillars
Operational Excellence: Automated testing ensures reliable deployments.
Reliability: Streamlined rollback mechanisms minimize downtime risks.
Cost Optimization: Eliminates redundant manual deployment processes.
Sustainability: Reduces inefficiencies in development cycles.
