# ADR N: Cloud Infrastructure and Hosting Strategy

# Forces Influencing the Decision
Technological: Scalability, uptime reliability, compliance with security standards.
Cost-related: Cloud pricing models, long-term operational costs.
Project Local: Performance optimization, regulatory requirements.

# Decision
We will deploy SmartMatch AI™ on AWS using a serverless architecture to optimize cost and scalability.

# Rationale
AWS offers robust security, scalability, and cost-efficient serverless capabilities. Other providers were considered but rejected due to various constraints:

Google Cloud was discarded due to pricing inconsistencies and feature gaps.
Azure was discarded due to team familiarity and combination concerns.

# Status
Proposed

# Consequences
Positive: High availability, reduced infrastructure maintenance, security compliance.
Negative: Vendor lock-in, complex monitoring for serverless components.

#Alignment with AWS Well-Architected Pillars
Operational Excellence: AWS automates maintenance tasks, reducing downtime.
Reliability: Built-in failover ensures SmartMatch AI™ remains accessible.
Cost Optimization: Serverless architecture minimizes idle compute costs.
Sustainability: Dynamic resource allocation reduces unnecessary power consumption.
