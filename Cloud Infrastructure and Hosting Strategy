# ADR N: Cloud Infrastructure and Hosting Strategy

## Forces Influencing the Decision:
Technological: Scalability, uptime reliability, compliance with security standards.
Cost-related: Cloud pricing models, long-term operational costs.
Project Local: Performance optimization, regulatory requirements.

## Decision 
We will deploy SmartMatch AI™ on AWS using a serverless architecture to optimize cost and scalability.

## Rationale 
AWS provides robust security, scalability, and cost-efficient serverless capabilities. Other providers like Google Cloud and Azure were considered but rejected due to pricing models and expertise constraints. Alternatives were rejected:

Google Cloud was discarded due to pricing inconsistencies and feature gaps.
Azure was discarded due to team familiarity and integration concerns.

## Status
Proposed 

## Consequences
Positive: High availability, reduced infrastructure maintenance, security compliance.
Negative: Vendor lock-in, complex monitoring for serverless components.

Alignment with AWS Well-Architected Pillars: Operational Excellence: AWS automates maintenance tasks, reducing downtime. Reliability: Built-in failover ensures SmartMatch AI™ remains accessible. Cost Optimization: Serverless architecture minimizes idle compute costs. Sustainability: Dynamic resource allocation reduces unnecessary power consumption.
